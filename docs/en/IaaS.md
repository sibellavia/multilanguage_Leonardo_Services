### Pool Confidential Services

#### Services Description

These services enable the provision of Private virtual computing environments (IaaS), i.e., on a pool of physical resources, dedicated and isolated for each individual customer, based on the use of bare metal computing instances.  
Data from physical resources is encrypted and kept secure throughout all phases of use (at rest, in transit, and in use), leveraging the Confidential Computing paradigm.  
Depending on the pool of computing resources required for each individual Administration, the most suitable service from the four available types can be selected.

#### Features and Advantages

Private Cloud resources are dedicated exclusively to each customer.  
The services use secure enclaves based on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) based on Confidential Hardware, which offer an advanced level of security for data in use, protecting it during processing.  
They support advanced encryption of data at rest, in transit, and in use.  
They use advanced remote attestation systems to verify the correctness of the TEE environment, isolating virtual machine memory from the host operating system and other malicious guests.

The services offer the following advantages:

- *Data security and confidentiality in dedicated environments*.  
- *Workload isolation* through advanced virtualization.
- *Dedicated firewalls and network micro-segmentation*.
- *Automated provisioning and rapid resource management*.
- *Comprehensive control and centralized governance*: centralized monitoring and auditing for traceability.
