Leonardo provides a collection of managed services which are represented in the following figure by type and sub-type (technically called "Family" and "Sub-family" respectively).

From a logical-functional perspective, these services can be divided into three macro-categories:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Container as a Service (CaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)

The IaaS and CaaS categories include some services from the "Compute" family. 
The PaaS category includes services from all other families.

The above macro-categories are described below, and for each of them, we provide a description of the services for each family and subfamily.
