# IT Service Management (ITSM)

The IT Service Management (ITSM) defines the process of the activities, responsibilities, and controls required to manage customer support requests in a structured, timely, and traceable manner.  
It applies to all types of tickets submitted by customers, including:

- Incidents (service disruptions or malfunctions).
- Service Requests (standard operational requests).
- Access Requests.
- Information Requests.
- Change-related inquiries.
- Other support needs requiring tracking and resolution.

The objective is to ensure consistent quality of service, reduce resolution times, improve resource coordination, and maintain complete traceability of customer interactions  
Each phase includes defined roles, expected outputs, and quality criteria.  
Leonardo's methodology for delivering and supporting its services is inspired by ITIL®.
The ITIL® framework has been used as a reference for delivering and improving services, particularly in the areas of Service Operation and Service Transition.

## Process Steps

1) **Ticket Intake**  
Customer requests may be submitted via email.  
Upon receipt, the Service Desk (or designated support function) performs:

- Logging of the request into the ticketing system.
- Attribution of a unique ticket ID.
- Initial verification of provided information.

All tickets are timestamped and stored for auditability.

2) **Classification and Prioritization**  
The Service Desk categorizes the ticket into one of the predefined classes (Incident, Request, Access, etc.).  
Priority is determined using criteria such as:

- Impact (number of users/services affected).
- Urgency (time sensitivity of the issue).
- Service criticality (business relevance of the affected system).

This ensures coherent treatment of tickets and alignment with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

3) **Assignment**  
After classification, the ticket is routed to the appropriate resolver group (e.g., Infrastructure, Application Support, Network Operations, Security, Service Delivery).  
Assignment criteria include:

- Required technical expertise.
- Workload distribution.
- Escalation rules.
- Operational hours and on-call availability.

The resolver group assumes ownership of the ticket until resolution.

4) **Assignment**  
After classification, the ticket is routed to the appropriate resolver group (e.g., Infrastructure, Application Support, Network Operations, Security, Service Delivery).  
Assignment criteria include:

- Required technical expertise.
- Workload distribution.
- Escalation rules.
- Operational hours and on-call availability.

The resolver group assumes ownership of the ticket until resolution.

5) **Investigation and Resolution**  
The assigned team performs root-cause investigation, corrective actions, or fulfillment activities depending on the ticket type.  
Typical activities include:

- System checks and diagnostics.
- Configuration adjustments.
- User guidance or remote assistance.
- Deployment of fixes or patches.
- Coordination with third-party vendors when applicable.

Progress is continuously updated in the ticketing system.

6) **Customer Communication**  
The customer is informed throughout the lifecycle of the ticket, including:

- Acknowledgement of receipt
- Status updates (especially for high-priority issues)
- Request for additional information
- Notification upon resolution

Communication follows predefined templates and response-time commitments.

7) **Ticket Closure**  
A ticket is closed only when:

- The solution has been delivered and validated.
- The customer has been informed.
- Documentation of actions taken is complete.
- Linked tickets (if any) have been updated.

Quality controls ensure closure accuracy and SLA compliance.

## Escalation Management

Escalations ensure that prolonged or high-impact issues receive timely attention.  
They include:

- Functional escalation to more specialized teams.
- Hierarchical escalation to management when SLA breaches or major impacts are imminent.
- Vendor escalation for third-party system dependencies.
- Escalation paths and thresholds are predefined within the support framework.

##  Monitoring and Quality Assurance

Performance of the Ticket Management Process is monitored through KPIs such as:

- Ticket resolution time
- SLA compliance rate
- First Contact Resolution rate
- Backlog volume and aging
- Customer satisfaction feedback

Periodic reviews identify improvement opportunities and ensure adherence to service standards.
