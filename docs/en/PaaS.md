- *Data Encryption* → Key Vault As A Service can encrypt and decrypt workloads running on the PA infrastructure without archiving them, managing the entire lifecycle of the cryptographic material used in the encryption process.
- *Leasing and Renewal* → Key Vault As A Service associates a lease with each key or secret managed, which will result in its automatic revocation upon expiration and which can be renewed by clients through the integrated APIs provided by the platform.
- *Revocation* → Key Vault As A Service has integrated support for revoking keys and secrets, which can be revoked individually or in bulk (e.g., all keys of a specific user), for example in case of compromise.

The service is provided using Hashicorp Vault technology. 
The service offers high availability and geographic replication.  
The main workflow of Key Vault as a Service consists of four phases:
- *Authentication* → The process by which a client provides information that Key Vault as a Service uses to determine the authenticity of the requester. Once the client is authenticated, the system generates a token that is associated with the relevant policy.
- *Validation* → Validation occurs through trusted third-party sources, such as Active Directory, LDAP, and Okta.
- *Authorization* → The client is then associated with the Key Vault as a Service security policy, which consists of a set of rules that define which API endpoints a user, machine, or application is allowed or denied access to with its token.
- *Access* → Key Vault as a Service then grants access to keys and encryption features, secrets, and certificates.

The service offers the following advantages:
- *Risk reduction* → thanks to automatic key rotation and secret lifecycle management, it increases the protection of sensitive data, simplifies regulatory compliance and reduces the risk of human errors.
- *Operational efficiency and cost reduction* → less internal management, automation and standardization, scalability without hardware investment.
- *Optimized time-to-market* → developers focus on code, not key management; also enables secure applications to be delivered faster, improving agility and innovation.
- *Improved trust and reputation* → audit and traceability to demonstrate secure secret management to stakeholders or customers.
- *Cryptographic and standardized compliance* → can be configured to use FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) validated cryptographic modules, ensuring that all encryption, signing, HMAC and key derivation operations comply with the standards.
